rc3 NOWHERE map of FraMa
========================

This is the map of the shared assembly of CCC [Frankfurt] and CCC [Mannheim].

Usage
-----

Execute automapping (Ctrl+M) after changing the map. (adds collison, fixes and finishes several things)

Only edit the `.tmx` maps and `.tsx` tilesets.

Edit source `.png`s if a `.png` has a `.kra` of the same name next to it.

All generated `.png`s and the `.json` map files can be generated with:

```
make all
```

Lint the map like
```
make lint LINT=/tmp/binwalint/dist/walint
```
